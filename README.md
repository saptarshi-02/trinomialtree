# trinomialtree
This script implements the Trinomial Option Tree Model, a numerical method used to price European call and put options. The model simulates the evolution of stock prices over multiple periods, considering three possible price changes at each step: an upward movement, a downward movement, and a middle or unchanged price. The parameters needed for this model include the initial stock price, strike price, volatility, time to maturity, number of periods, interest rate, and lambda (a scaling factor that controls the magnitude of price movements). The script first calculates the up and down factors (u and d) for stock price movements and then computes the corresponding risk-neutral probabilities for each movement. Option prices are determined through backward induction, starting from the final period where the option values are calculated based on the payoff function (max(0, S-K) for a call option and max(0, K-S) for a put option). These values are then propagated backward through the tree to determine the option price at the initial node. The final result is a visual representation of both the stock price tree and the option price tree and allows users to input their own parameters, making it flexible for different scenarios in options pricing.
